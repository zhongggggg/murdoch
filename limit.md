Detection Limitations:
========================================
Zero-Day Exploits:

Description: The script primarily relies on signature-based detection and monitoring for known patterns or behaviors. It may struggle to identify and respond to zero-day exploits or novel attack techniques not covered by existing signatures.

Implication: Attackers employing previously unseen methods may go undetected until new signatures or detection mechanisms are developed.


False Positives:

Description: The detection setup may generate false positives, triggering alerts for normal system activities that resemble malicious behavior. This can lead to alert fatigue and potentially distract from real threats.

Implication: Security personnel might spend time investigating false alarms, diverting resources from genuine security incidents.


Limited Visibility:

Description: The script focuses on monitoring specific log entries related to root access and changes in the root directory. It may not provide comprehensive visibility into lateral movement or activities outside the targeted scope.

Implication: Sophisticated attacks involving multiple stages or lateral movement might escape detection, limiting the overall effectiveness of the monitoring approach.



Mitigation Limitations:
========================================
Backup Deletion Awareness:

Description: 
While the script outlines a comprehensive backup strategy, it doesn't specifically address detection of attempts to delete or compromise the backup files. Attackers aware of the backup locations might intentionally target and delete them.

Implication: In the event of a compromise, attackers could erase or manipulate backups, hindering the restoration process and potentially prolonging the impact of the incident.



Dependency on Email Alerts:

Description: 
The script relies on email alerts for notifying administrators of unauthorized access or malicious activities. This dependency introduces potential delays and risks associated with the compromise of email systems.

Implication: If email alerts are compromised or delayed, administrators may not receive timely notifications, impacting the speed of incident response.



Assumption of Administrator Intervention:

Description: 
The mitigation steps in the script assume prompt and effective intervention by administrators once an alert is received. In a real-world scenario, response times can vary, and immediate intervention may not always be feasible.

Implication: Delays in incident response could allow attackers more time to exploit vulnerabilities or inflict further damage before containment measures are implemented.
