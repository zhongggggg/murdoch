========== Post-Incident Activity ==========

The aim of conducting a post-incident activity is to understand how the incident
happened and what we can do to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

A post-incident review also identifies areas for improvement, such that there will be
a better response should similar incidents re-occur.

Conduct a Lessons Learned Analysis:
